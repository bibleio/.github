Innovating the industry of Bible technology.

We focus on design, making the Bible free to access for everyone (including devs!), accessibility features, and speediness.

We plan on rewriting our backends with Rust, and on building a Bible API in Rust, which will soon include major translation such as ESV, NIV, and CSB.

Matthew 10:8 "Freely you have received; freely give."
